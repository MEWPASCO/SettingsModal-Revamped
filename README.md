# Settings Modal Revamped

Creates a small pop-up like window for the Settings Modal instead of it being a wasted fullscreen!

After:

# Installing it to your Discord

Use [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) or an equivalent client mod that allows you to install themes.

Paste the following link into your online theme links:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MEWPASCO/xxx
```

### Other method 
Paste this into your QuickCSS (Or any non-Vencord equivalent) to make it a little easier:
> [!NOTE]
> Must be at the top of your code, @import does not work otherwise - this is for all the @import code you might have - put it to the top!  
```
/* Change visual refresh title bar */
@import url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MEWPASCO/xxx/main/xxx');
```

### Important Notice
**If you are on a browser, Vesktop, or a client which does not come with window controls, this fork is not aimed at you**

Alternatively if your client does not support online themes you can download the theme file found in this repository and put it into your theme folder.

# Configuration

Put this into your QuickCSS (Or any non-Vencord equivalent) to configure some behavior of this theme:
```css
/* SettingsModal Revamped Config */
:root {
xxx
}
```
